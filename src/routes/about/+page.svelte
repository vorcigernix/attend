				<h3 class="font-semibold">So what is this about?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					I have a regular floorball (I hear you, shame on you, it is the best game on the planet)
					training with like 12 friends. We need to know if there are at least six of us going
					because we can't play with fewer. Therefore, attendance information is kinda important to
					us. There are more use cases - going to the pub with friends, Sunday sermons, and game
					parties. Basically, everything where you need to know if your friends are joining you at
					an event.

				<h3 class="font-semibold">Why have you created this app?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					All the apps we tried either cost money, were overcomplicated, or completely unreliable. I
					decided to invest a little of my time building something simpler. I kinda underestimated
					the effort to be honest, but I like what I have created. My hope is this will be useful to
					people with the same need.

					Yes. I have designed this app to be simple for a reason. If you find something is missing
					that is crucial for your gang, don't hesitate to drop me a line. <a

				<h3 class="font-semibold">What is your business model?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					I don't have any. Honestly, I am super lame when it comes to money. You can support me at

				<h3 class="font-semibold">Is this only for men, dude?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					Nah. Sorry about that, no offense meant. Dude RSVP was like the first idea for a name that
					kinda survived. It definitely does not mean that I don't want people who identify
					themselves differently here. Your gender/orientation/nationality/skin color is completely
					your business unless you support Putin's bloody war on Ukraine.

				<h3 class="font-semibold">How do I log in?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					You don't. You can <a href="/validate" class="font-bold text-lime-500 typogra"
						>claim your nickname</a
					> though and we will disallow anyone else to use your nickname. This process rely on blockchain
					technology and cryptography.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					On the blockchain we save your nickname, public key and unique ID (both generated on your
					computer). The whole system is completely safe as long as your computer is safe - most
					dangerous to your internet security are generally browser plugins.
