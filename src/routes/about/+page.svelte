				<h3 class="font-semibold">So what is this about?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					I have a regular floorbal (I hear you, shame on you, it is a best game on the planet)
					training with like 12 frens. We need to know if there is at least six of us coming, can't
					play in less. So the information about attendance is kinda important to us. There are more
					use cases - regular pub with frens, Sunday sermons, game parties. Basically everything
					where you need to know if your frens are joining you on the event.

				<h3 class="font-semibold">Why have you created this app?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					All the apps we tried are either paid, overcomplicated or completely unreliable. So I
					decided to invest a little of my time to build something more simple. I kinda
					underestimated the effort to be honest, but I like what I built and I hope this would be
					useful to the people with the same need.

					Yes. This is built as a minimal product for the reason. If you really miss something

				<h3 class="font-semibold">What is your business model?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					I don't have any. Honestly, I am super lame wen it comes to money. You can support me at
					adamsobotka.eth.

				<h3 class="font-semibold">How do I log in?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					There is no authentication yet. I don't want to handle any personal information or
					anything like that. I do have an idea based cryptography, but that will take some time to
					implement.

				<h3 class="font-semibold">Is it only for man, dude?</h3>
				<p class="mt-1 text-zinc-200">
					Nah. Sorry about that, no offense meant. Dude RSVP was like the first idea for name that
					kinda survived. It definitely does not mean that I don't want people who identify
					themselves differently here. Your gender/orientation/nationality/skin color is completely
					your business unless you support Putin's bloody war on Ukraine.
